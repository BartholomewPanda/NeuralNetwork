# NeuralNetwork

NeuralNetwork is a simple OCaml library that I'm coding for the fun and to experiment some things. This one is not made to be fast or optimized! It allows to easily make network with different "topology": simple feedforward network, reccurent network, etc.


# TODO

- look the code, work and remove the TODO in the code
- add oasis to easily make the project
- add new examples
- batch backpropagation
- give the possibility to use another function than sigmoid for each neuron
- try to make a generic genetic algorithm to train the network
- optimize the code
- (insert many things here)
